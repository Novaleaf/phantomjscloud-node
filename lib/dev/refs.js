/**
 *  The ```bluebird-retry``` module:  https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird-retry
utility for retrying a bluebird promise until it succeeds
This very simple library provides a function for retrying an asynchronous operation until it succeeds. An "asynchronous operation" is embodied by a function that returns a promise or returns synchronously.

It supports regular intervals and exponential backoff with a configurable limit, as well as an overall timeout for the operation that limits the number of retries.

The bluebird library supplies the promise implementation.

Basic Usage
var Promise = require('bluebird');
var retry = require('bluebird-retry');

var count = 0;
function myfunc() {
    console.log('myfunc called ' + (++count) + ' times');
    if (count < 3) {
        return Promise.reject(new Error('fail the first two times'));
    } else {
        return Promise.resolve('succeed the third time');
    }
}

retry(myfunc).done(function(result) {
    console.log(result);
});
